This program makes it easy for young kids to do treasure hunts around the house that require decrypting clues.


# How to use

1. Edit `clues.txt` to include your clues, one clue per line (blank lines are ignored).
1. Run `python kid-crypt.py` and it will output the results.
1. Print, cut with scissors and hide the clues.
1. Remember to include treasure at the end!

# Prerequisites

You'll need to install [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for this to work. I've tested this with Python 3.8.
